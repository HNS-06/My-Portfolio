  // About Section
  about: {
    introduction: `I'm a passionate developer and designer with over 5 years of experience creating digital solutions. 
    I love turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs.`,
    
    journey: [
      `Started as a self-taught developer, I've grown into a full-stack engineer who bridges 
      the gap between design and development. My background in both fields allows me to 
      create cohesive, user-focused products.`,
      
      `I specialize in React, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern design tools. When I'm not 
      coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, 
      or mentoring aspiring developers.`,
      
      `I believe great software is not just functional, but also delightful to use. 
      Every project is an opportunity to craft something meaningful and impactful.`
